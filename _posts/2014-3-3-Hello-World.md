## How Magnetic Storms Impact Satellites and Electronics

The data that is used is based on the March 2015 solar storm, specifically the 17th to 18th of March 2015. The data was gotten from a website called “Virtual Solar Observatory” [1]. This website shows solar data on certain time periods from many different perspectives. The dataset that is analyzed shows a positivistic and quantitative paradigm, which emphasises objective and measurable data. The data itself contains information about the energy released by the sun every few seconds. I chose this data because it shows key information on the solar storm that happend on those days. It tells me the strength and time intervals of each solar flare that hit earth's magnetic field.

A Recomended paper related to the data is called "Coronal Mass Ejections: a Summary of Recent Results" [2]. This paper accurately describes the properties of solar flares and coronal mass ejections and graphs displaying relative information about them.
